# Contribute

The Atlas of Regenerative Materials seeks to build a network of professionals in Switzerland and beyond who are deeply and genuinely committed to transforming the culture of the built environment towards regenerative practices.

We warmly welcome architects, engineers, building physicists, craftsmen and -women, construction companies, associations, and material suppliers who share the values expressed in the Manifesto. These are professionals who work to implement and promote frugal practices, prioritizing the preservation of existing structures over demolition, selecting materials for their low carbon footprint and local sourcing, and considering the social benefit of their choices as an integral part of their work. The size of the projects, whether new constructions or renovations, is not of great importance to us. What truly matters is the approach taken to accomplish them.

The scientific review committee of the Atlas reserves the right to reject submissions that do not meet the value presented in the Manifesto of Regenerative Materials. Each project or professional submission will be reviewed by a committee of experts specialized in regenerative materials and practices to assess its relevance for inclusion.

Please note that this is not a commercial site, and under no circumstances do we intend to promote products or serve as an advertising platform.
If you agree to contribute to the Atlas of Regenerative Materials you will also become an active reviewer of the new or edited entries.
