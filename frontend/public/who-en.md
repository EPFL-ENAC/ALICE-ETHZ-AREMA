# Who we are

The Atlas of Regenerative Materials originates as a project from the Chair of Sustainable Construction at ETH Zurich, led by Professor Guillaume Habert.

The project was made possible thanks to the initial support of the Ricola Foundation, and the ETH Domain Open Research Data Program .

The Atlas is currently developed in collaboration with Shoshana Huber, a mechanical engineer and craftswoman specialized in sustainable construction, Alia Bengana, an architect, educator, author specialized in regenerative materials (EPFL, HEIA Fribourg, eav&t Paris-Est), and Rome Villa Medicis fellow 2025-2026, and web developer Yannick Marcon from ENAC-IT4R at EPFL.

Additionally, the Atlas benefits from an External Advisory Board, composed of leading experts from industry, philanthropy, and academia. A dedicated expert community ensures the peer review of new contributions, maintaining the vision expressed in our Manifesto, rigor and quality of the Atlas.
