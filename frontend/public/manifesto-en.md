# Manifesto

We stand at a critical moment in the history of our built environment. The materials we choose today shape not only the structures we inhabit but also the future of our planet and the cohesion of our societies. We are convinced that renewable bio-based materials—such as wood and fibers from agriculture—minimally processed geo-based materials like earth and stone, as well as those derived from reuse, must reclaim their essential role in our building culture.

With the construction sector responsible for over 40% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions, the urgency for a transition is undeniable. Decarbonizing our built environment requires a paradigm shift—one that prioritizes locally sourced, regenerative materials over carbon-intensive, extractive practices.

For us, regenerative does not merely describe a new trend or a new label for greenwashed practices. It signifies a fundamental shift in our values and actions. It draws on the wisdom of bioregionalism and has been shaped by thinkers such as Ray Cole, Chrisna du Plessis, Bill Reed and more recently Sarah Ichioka and Michael Pawlyn who framed what regenerative thinking would mean for architecture and construction. We ground our vision within their work, and consider Regenerative materials as materials which have the capacity, if wisely used to restore and enhance natural systems, and create resilient, fair communities that can thrive in balance with nature, while improving their health and standards of living.

To trigger this transition, the Atlas of regenerative materials aims to empower a wide spectrum of stakeholders—construction professionals, public administrations, real estate owners, engineers and architecture students, as well as the general public. Through education and awareness, we seek to challenge misconceptions, inspire innovation, and enable informed choices that prioritize environmental and social well-being.

The Atlas of Regenerative Materials is conceived as an open-source digital platform that fosters transparency, accessibility, and collaboration across the whole value chain. This initiative seeks to map available resources, describe the diversity of building materials derived from these resources and detail their characteristics and performance. It shows constructive details that enhance technical understanding and support knowledge transfer. Finally, it showcases professionals and exemplary projects.

The Atlas wants to contributes to a fundamental transformation of the way we build. By reconnecting material selection with regional ecosystems, bioregional supply chains, and circular principles, we can drive the emergence of climate-neutral and culturally embedded building practices. This shift is not only necessary to meet global carbon reduction goals by 2050 but also to foster a more just and resilient society.
We call on policymakers, practitioners, researchers, and communities to join us in this collective adventure. The time to rethink and reshape our material world is now.

**Doing less bad is just not good enough, we need to think regenerative!**
